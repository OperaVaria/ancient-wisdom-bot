# Ancient Wisdom Daily - Social Media Bot

This is a multi-platform social media bot that is set up to post a random
Ancient Greek or Roman quote every day, with translation and a short context comment.
The app is written in Python and the quote database uses the SQLite engine.
For better accessibility, the contents of the database are also available in
.cvs and .json formats in the [db folder](https://github.com/OperaVaria/ancient-wisdom-bot/tree/main/db).

New items are added to the database continuously.
