# Ancient Wisdom Daily - Twitter bot

This is a simple Twitter bot that is set up to post a random
Ancient Greek or Roman quote of wisdom every day, with translation
and a short comment. The script is written in Python and the quote
database was built with the SQlite engine. However, for better accessibility,
the contents of the database is also available in .cvs and .json formats
(src/db folder).

The app connects to the Twitter API [via Tweepy](https://www.tweepy.org/).
